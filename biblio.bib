abstract = {Multi-core computers give the opportunity to solve high-performance applications more efficiently by using parallel computing. In this way, it is possible to achieve the same results in less time compared to the non-parallel version. Since computers continue to grow on the number of cores, we need to make our parallel applications scalable. This paper shows how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in a non-parallel version takes long time to solve an optimization problem; in comparison, using multi-core parallel computing the processing time can be reduced significantly as the number of cores grows. The tests were made on a quad-core computer; a comparison of the speeding up in relation to the number of cores is shown. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A GA allows a population composed of many individuals to evolve under specified selection rules to a state that maximizes the "fitness" function. In that process, crossover operator plays an important role. To comprehend the GAs as a whole, it is necessary to understand the role of a crossover operator. Today, there are a number of different crossover operators that can be used in GAs. However, how to decide what operator to use for solving a problem? A number of test functions with various levels of difficulty has been selected as a test polygon for determine the performance of crossover operators. In this paper, a novel crossover operator called 'ring crossover' is proposed. In order to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed operator, a comparison between the results of this study and results of different crossover operators used in GAs is made through a number of test functions with various levels of difficulty. Results of this study clearly show significant differences between the proposed operator and the other crossover operators.},

abstract = {The use of containers in cloud architec-tures has become widespread, owing to advantages such as limited overheads, easier and faster deploy-ment, and higher portability. Moreover, they present a suitable architectural solution for the deployment of applications created using a microservice devel-opment pattern. Despite the large number of solu-tions and implementations, there remain open issues that have not been completely addressed in container automation and management. Container resource allo-cation influences system performance and resource consumption, and so it is a key factor for cloud providers. We propose a genetic algorithm approach, using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), to optimize container allocation and elasticity management, motivated by the good results obtained with this algorithm in other resource man-agement optimization problems in cloud architectures. Our optimization algorithm enhances system provi-sioning, system performance, system failure, and net-work overhead. A model for cloud clusters, containers, microservices, and four optimization objectives is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is a suitable solution for addressing the problem of container allocation and elasticity, and it obtains better objective values than the container management policies implemented in Kubernetes.},

Palabras Claves: programaci{\'{o}}n funcional, paradigma funcional, abstracci{\'{o}}n de datos, funciones de orden superior, evaluaci{\'{o}}n perezosa, transparencia referencial, tipos de datos 1. Introducci{\'{o}}n Hace ya bastante tiempo, cuando cursaba mis {\'{u}}ltimos a{\~{n}}os en la Universidad, form{\'{e}} parte de un proyecto de investigaci{\'{o}}n en arquitecturas de computadoras. En este proyecto analiz{\'{a}}bamos y clasific{\'{a}}bamos todas los posibles tipos de arquitecturas existentes, desde las comunes y ubicuas PC a las lejanas (para nosotros) supercomputadoras paralelas. En ese proyecto, a la par de descubrir que no todas las computadoras eran PC, y que no todas ten{\'{i}}an un solo procesador y del mismo tipo, me di cuenta asimismo que los lenguajes de programaci{\'{o}}n que utilizaban tampoco eran similares. Claro que ya hab{\'{i}}a aprendido el omnipresente Pascal, algo de C, C++, y la nueva ola de los lenguajes orientados y basados en objetos, pero lo que me llam{\'{o}} la atenci{\'{o}}n, no fueron las variaciones sobre estos {\'{u}}ltimos lenguajes, Rivadera: La Programaci{\'{o}}n Funcional 64 sino otros radicalmente distintos, dise{\~{n}}ados muchas veces en forma especial para m{\'{a}}quinas espec{\'{i}}ficas. Para comenzar, estos lenguajes no ordenaban sus computaciones (instrucciones) en forma secuencial, sino que el orden estaba dado por, en el caso particular de los funcionales, la aplicaci{\'{o}}n de funciones a otras funciones, resultando por tanto, innecesaria la existencia de variables. Finalmente, este proyecto me llev{\'{o}} a investigar sobre los diferentes paradigmas de programaci{\'{o}}n. Un paradigma de programaci{\'{o}}n es una forma espec{\'{i}}fica de realizar las computaciones. Un lenguaje de programaci{\'{o}}n siempre sigue un paradigma o una mezcla de varios; por ejemplo el paradigma procedimental es seguido por la mayor{\'{i}}a de los lenguajes actuales, tales como JAVA, Pascal y C++. Tambi{\'{e}}n podemos encontrar lenguajes con la influencia de dos paradigmas, por ejemplo el antes mencionado C++, que tiene su origen procedimental y al cual se le ha agregado el paradigma orientado a objetos.},

The JavaScript tooling landscape has grown and matured drastically in the past several years. This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries, frameworks, and utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers. It covers tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side. While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev focuses on incredibly useful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores. The libraries and frameworks covered include Bower, Grunt, Yeoman, PM2, RequireJS, Browserify, Knockout, AngularJS, Kraken, Mach, Mongoose, Knex, Bookshelf, Faye, Q, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash. Written from first-hand experience, you will benefit from the glorious victories and innumerable failures of two experienced professionals, gain quick insight into hurdles that aren't always explicitly mentioned in API documentation or Readmes, and quickly learn how to use JavaScript frameworks and libraries like a Pro.

@article{Hows2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Scaling the system to hundreds of nodes presented several unexpected challenges and required the development of software for automatically managing deployment, reporting, and error handling.

In this paper we address critical gaps in first-generation serverless computing, which place its autoscaling potential at odds with dominant trends in modern computing: notably data-centric and distributed computing, but also open source and custom hardware. Put together, these gaps make current serverless offerings a bad fit for cloud innovation and particularly bad for data systems innovation. In addition to pinpointing some of the main shortfalls of current serverless architectures, we raise a set of challenges we believe must be met to unlock the radical potential that the cloud---with its exabytes of storage and millions of cores---should offer to innovative developers.},

abstract = {Developing a new web application should not mean reinventing the wheel. Thats why a framework is an essential item in your development toolbox. It helps you respect coding standards; write bulletproof, maintainable code; and focus on business rules rather than waste time on repetitive tasks. This book introduces you to symfony, the leading framework for PHP developers, showing you how to wield its many features to develop web applications faster and more efficiently, even if you only know a bit of PHP. In The Definitive Guide to symfony, you will learn about the Model-View-Controller architecture and the crucial role it plays in making frameworks like symfony possible. The book also covers framework installation and configuration, and shows you how to build pages, deal with templates, manage requests and sessions, and communicate with databases and servers. You will see how symfony can make your life easier by effectively managing form data, enhancing the user experience with Ajax, internationalizing applications for a global audience, and using smart URLs. Authors Fran{\c{c}}ois Zaninotto and Fabien Potencier put a strong emphasis on the tools that symfony provides for professional environments, showing you how to take advantage of unit tests, scaffolding, plug-ins, the command line, and extensible configuration. And since frameworks often raise performance-related debate, this book will give you many tips and techniques for monitoring and improving your applications performance, from caching to expert configuration tweaks. Always keen to offer practical instruction, the authors include lots of code examples, expert tips, best practices, and illustrations throughout this book, with the goal of providing a resource that satisfies the educational needs of symfony's rapidly growing user community.},

@article{Blum2005,
abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate and elaborate various stategies of adapting mutation within evolutionary algorithms. Since the early development of evolutionary optimization, adaption has always been a topic of research and numerous strategies with different levels and types of adapation have been proposed. Our motivation is the application of evolutionary algorithms for solving real-world optimization problems, which often requires a problem-specific algorithm de-sign. The complex customization of the algorithms to the specific problem either needs a specialist or limits the field of application to mainly scientific research. But there is a growing demand for up-to-date optimization software, applicable by a non-specialist within an industrial development environment. A possible way to supply this demand are intelligent algorithms containing a mechanism to modify the pa-rameters without external control. This process of dynamic adaption happens while the algorithm is searching for the problem solution. Within this study we investigate different adaption methods regarding their effect on optimization results. The discussion of these results shall give an indication towards promising self-adapting strategies for practical application.},

abstract="This work presents the EvoSpace model for the development of pool-based evolutionary algorithms (Pool-EA). Conceptually, the EvoSpace model is built around a central repository or population store, incorporating some of the principles of the tuple-space model and adding additional features to tackle some of the issues associated with Pool-EAs; such as, work redundancy, starvation of the population pool, unreliability of connected clients or workers, and a large parameter space. The model is intended as a platform to develop search algorithms that take an opportunistic approach to computing, allowing the exploitation of freely available services over the Internet or volunteer computing resources within a local network. A comprehensive analysis of the model at both the conceptual and implementation levels is provided, evaluating performance based on efficiency, optima found and speedup, while providing a comparison with a standard EA and an island-based model. The issues of lost connections and system parametrization are studied and validated experimentally with encouraging results, that suggest how EvoSpace can be used to develop and implement different Pool-EAs for search and optimization.",

abstract = "One of the main reasons for using parallel evolutionary algorithms (PEAs) is to obtain efficient algorithms with an execution time much lower than that of their sequential counterparts in order, e.g., to tackle more complex problems. This naturally leads to measuring the speedup of the PEA. PEAs have sometimes been reported to provide super-linear performances for different problems, parameterizations, and machines. Super-linear speedup means that using “m” processors leads to an algorithm that runs more than “m” times faster than the sequential version. However, reporting super-linear speedup is controversial, especially for the “traditional” research community, since some non-orthodox practices could be thought of being the cause for this result. Therefore, we begin by offering a taxonomy for speedup, in order to clarify what is being measured. Also, we analyze the sources for such a scenario in this paper. Finally, we study an assorted set of results. Our conclusion is that super-linear performance is possible for PEAs, theoretically and in practice, both in homogeneous and in heterogeneous parallel machines."

abstract="Optimization problems are present in many fields of science, engineering, and industry. In most cases, optimization problems involve a large number of complex decision variables. Often, the application of fuzzy systems to traditional control strategies requires the use of optimization techniques to define the parameters of the membership functions capturing the designer's experience. Currently, bioinspired algorithms are one of the most widely used methods for fuzzy system optimization. In this paper, we review the literature on the application of different bioinspired techniques such as Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Galaxy Swarm Optimization, Harmony Search, Firefly, Differential Evolution, to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy controllers. We found particular trends in the current literature, with many methods using dynamic parameter adaptation, hybrids, distributed algorithms, and type-2 fuzzy logic.",
